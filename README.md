# Ideas

Frontend client for Ideas, an app for grouping quotes into conceptual ideas.

Implemented with Ember.js using the preview version of the upcoming [Octane edition](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/). This app will be kept up-to-date with the latest Octane features and serves as a good example of a "typical" Ember app using Octane.

Powered by a Rails JSON:API backend, [ideas-api](https://github.com/CodingItWrong/ideas-api).
